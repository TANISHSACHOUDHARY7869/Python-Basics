        "\n",
        "# ans:- In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire source code into machine code before running it, an interpreter translates and runs the code one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Key Points:\n",
        "# The Python interpreter processes your .py files.\n",

        "3) What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " ans:- In Python, pre-defined keywords (also called reserved words) are special words that have specific meanings and purposes in the language. These keywords are reserved by Python, which means you cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Python Keywords:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",

        "\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "Keywords are reserved by the language because they have special meanings in Python's syntax. If you try to use a keyword as a variable name, Python will raise a SyntaxError.\n",

        "5) What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans:- In Python, mutability refers to whether an object‚Äôs value can be changed after it is created.\n",

        "Types of Objects Based on Mutability:\n",

        "6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans:- Lists are mutable and tuples are immutable in Python because of design choices made to balance flexibility and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "üîÅ Why lists are mutable:\n",
        "Purpose: Lists are meant to be flexible collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can add, remove, or change elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Useful for dynamic data, like storing items in a shopping cart or updating records\n",

        "Purpose: Tuples are used to represent fixed collections of items.\n",

        "\n",
        "10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans:- The difference between implicit and explicit type casting in Python lies in who performs the conversion ‚Äî the interpreter or the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "üîπ Implicit Type Casting:\n",
        "Done automatically by Python.\n",

        "\n",
        "11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "ans:- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. These statements help the program choose different actions depending on whether a condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "üîë Key Types of Conditional Statements in Python:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "ans:-ChatGPT said:\n",
        "The **elif** (short for \"else if\") statement in Python is used when you want to check multiple conditions in sequence. It's an extension of the if statement, allowing you to test several conditions after an initial if condition, without needing to nest multiple if statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "How elif Works:\n",
        "The program first evaluates the if condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the if condition is True, it runs the corresponding block of code and skips all elif and else statements.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "If none of the if or elif conditions are True, the program runs the else block, if it exists.\n",

        "\n",
        "14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "ans:-A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in scenarios where you don‚Äôt know how many iterations are required in advance, and the loop needs to continue until a certain condition is met. This makes the while loop ideal for cases where the number of iterations is dynamic and depends on factors that may change during the execution of the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example Scenario: Guessing Game\n",
        "Imagine you're creating a guessing game, where a user needs to guess a secret number, but the number of attempts isn't known beforehand. The game should continue running until the user guesses the number correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, a while loop is appropriate because you don‚Äôt know how many attempts it will take for the user to guess the number correctly\n",
        "Why the while loop is more suitable here:\n",
        "Unknown number of iterations: The user might need any number of guesses to find the correct answer. You don‚Äôt know how many iterations the loop will take, so a while loop that checks the condition (True in this case) and runs until the guess is correct works perfectly.\n",

        "Condition-based exit: The loop exits when the user guesses the correct number, making the while loop a natural choice for such dynamic, condition-based scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Contrast with for loop:\n",
        "If you used a for loop, you'd have to know the number of attempts in advance or loop over a predefined sequence (like a fixed number of guesses), which wouldn't fit the dynamic nature of the game. The while loop handles this situation more flexibly.\n",
